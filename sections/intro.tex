We have previously submitted an earlier version of this paper to VENUE. 
Based on the reviewer's comments we created a major revision of the paper. 

Overall, the reviewers agreed that the idea was good but identified a number of weaknesses.
We addressed these issues, as well as the other points raised by the reviewers in this submission. 
Most importantly, we completely restructured our idea.
We now do something specific.
