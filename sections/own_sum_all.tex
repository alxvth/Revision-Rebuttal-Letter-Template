\paragraph{Issue 1}
Lacking justification for everything (R1, R2, R3, R4). 

\begin{response} \label{res:summary:justification}
We justified all the stuff now.
\end{response}


\paragraph{Issue 2}
The proposed method should have been better (R1, R2).

\begin{response} \label{res:summary:better}
The reviews should have been better. Also, see \autoref{res:summary:justification} as well as \Autoref{res:rev1:weak:math, res:rev1:detail:types}.
