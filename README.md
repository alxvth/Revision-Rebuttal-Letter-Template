# Revision and Rebuttal Letter Template

This template is based on the ideas in the [Paper Submission Revision Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vef5VaW1j_vtg5z9lWJo4aKgzM0hUe3UnfBdY6-_1DM/edit) by Leilani Battle presented at the IEEE Vis 2020 [Fail Fest Workshop](https://virtual.ieeevis.org/year/2020/session_w-failfest.html) ([failfest.github.io](https://failfest.github.io/)).

## Usage recommendations
Interleave reviewer comments with
``` latex
\begin{response}
    point-by-point respones,
\end{response}
```
that describe how you will tackle the raised concerns.
Ideally, phrase your responses in a past tense.
This way, you might be able to more easily re-use your responses when writing a final response letter.

Additionally, it can be helpful to first summarize each review in your own words and then outline main and recurring concerns, critiques and suggestions.
